However, one day a small mysterious dungeon appeared out of thin air and reeked havoc on the surrounding environment. The ground was infected with the miasma being emitted from the dungeon's opening, and monsters never seen before started coming out of the dungeon. The once peaceful village was turned into a deserted ghostown within 2 years of the formation of the dungeon. Now, the place has become a legend with only rumors of its existence being spread.")
